## Seasonal-Trend decomposition
STL find the trend and seasonality and take the residual from the raw data versus the model.

```math
Raw_data - (trend + seasonnality) = residual
```

- Can use the residual to find anomalies (datapoints that are not explained by the trend and seasonality);
- Can use trend and seasonnality to forecast futur behavior;

## Loess:

Loess regression is a **nonparametric** technique that uses *local weighted* regression to fit a smooth curve through points in a scatter plot. Loess curves can reveal trends and cycles in data that might be difficult to model with a parametric curve.

It is a generalization of moving average and polynomial regression.

Requires fairly large, densely sampled data sets in order to produce good models. (a cause de l'utilisation de k-nn)

Prone to the effects of outliers in the data set, like other least squares methods. (si ca fait trop longtemps qu'on a une situation anormale, il va la trouvee normale)
